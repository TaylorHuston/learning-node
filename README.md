# Learning Node

Code to accompany Learning Node.js

# Modules

01. A simple client checking a site's status
  * Create file
	* Run and expect error
	* `npm install request`
	* Why is this type of utility of value?

02. Check status of multiple sites
  * Why are both returning 200?
  * What needs to be changed to get a 301? i.e. how is `request` "helping?"
  * What order are the results returned in? Is this predictable?

03. Testing
  * Why is testing important in a non-static language?
	* Make the file testable
	* Add a test


Extra:
* Keeping node up-to-date and switching versions:
  * n and nvm
* Deploying multiple versions of node using nvm (bucketed deployments)
